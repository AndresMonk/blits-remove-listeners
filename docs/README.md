# Blits - Lightning 3 App Development Framework

With Blits, the App Development Framework for Lightning 3, it becomes a breeze to build great Lightning 3 applications.

Blits is built on top of the Lightning 3 Renderer and aims to provide a **great developer experience**, making it fun and easy to build your apps!

Built from the ground up by the LightningJS team, we're offering a **Complete App framework**, full of features to speed up development, while keeping it **lightweight** with a focus on **performance**.

The Blits framework uses a **readable** XML-style template syntax and comes with built-in reactivity.

## Why Blits?

You may be wondering where the name Blits comes from?

Firstly, it's short, memorable and just has a nice ring to it.

"Blits" is a Dutch word (a significant portion of the Lightning Open Source teams is based in the Netherlands). It means _flashy_ and it's often used to for things that are _great_ or _cool_.

Finally it's a nerdy reference to the computer term "Bit Blits" commonly used in graphics processing, for rapidly moving a block of data into memory - quite similar to what Lightning is doing ðŸ™‚
