# Blits - Lightning 3 App Development Framework

With Blits (formaly know as Bolt), the App Development Framework for Lightning 3, it becomes a breeze to build great Lightning 3 applications.

Blits is built on top of the Lightning 3 Rendererer and aims to provide a **great developer experience**, making it fun and easy to build your apps!

Built from the ground up by the LightningJS team, we're offering a **Complete App framework**, full of features to speed up development, while keeping it **lightweight** with a focus on **performance**.

The Blits framework uses a **readable** XML-style template syntax and comes with built-in reactivity.

## Why Blits?

You may be wondering where the name Blits comes from?

Firstly, it short, memorable and has a nice ring to it. The name is derived from the word "Blitz", which means Lightning in German. Additionally, "Blits" is a Dutch term (a significant portion of the Lightning Open Source teams is based in the Netherlands) used to showcase something great or simply refer to things that are cool.

Finally it's a nerdy reference to the computer term "Bit Blits" commonly used in graphics processing, for rapidly moving a block of data into memory - quite similar to what Lightning is doing ðŸ™‚
