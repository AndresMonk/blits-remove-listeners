# Create a new Blits App

**The recommended way to start a Lightning 3 Blits App**

## Usage

In order to create a new L3 Blits App, all you need to do is run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


```bash
npm create @lightningjs/blits@latest
```

You will be guided through a short series of questions to generate a new project with all the boilerplate code you need to start building your own Lightning 3 App.

Once you're done, navigate to the newly create project folder, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to see your fresh Lightning 3 Blits App in action.
